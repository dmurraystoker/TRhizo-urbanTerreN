	abstract = {Likelihood-based regression models such as the normal linear regression model and the linear logistic model, assume a linear (or some other parametric) form for the covariates X1, X2, *--, Xp. We introduce the class of generalized additive models which replaces the linear form E fjXj by a sum of smooth functions E sj(Xj). The sj(.)'s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor q = E fjXj is replaced by the additive predictor E sj(Xj); hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model.},

@article{hogberg_1997,
	abstract = {Equilibrium and kinetic isotope fractionations during incomplete reactions result in minute differences in the ratio between the two stable X isotopes, 15N and 14N, in various N pools. In ecosystems such variations (usually expressed in per mil [δ15N] deviations from the standard atmospheric N2) depend on isotopic signatures of inputs and outputs, the input-output balance, N transformations and their specific isotope effects, and compartmentation of N within the system. Products along a sequence of reactions, e.g. the N mineralization-N uptake pathway, should, if fractionation factors were equal for the different reactions, become progressively depleted. However, fractionation factors van. For example, because nitrification discriminates against 15N in the substrate more than does N mineralization, NH4+can become isotopically heavier than the organic N from which it is derived. Levels of isotopic enrichment depend dynamically on the stoichiometry of reactions, as well as on specific abiotic and biotic conditions. Thus, the δ15N of a specific N pool is not a constant, and 15N of a N compound added to the system is not a conservative, unchanging tracer. This fact, together with analytical problems of measuring 15N in small and dynamic pools of N in the soil-plant system, and the complexity of the X cycle itself (for instance the abundance of reversible reactions), limit the possibilities of making inferences based on observations of 15N abundance in one or a few pools of N in a system. Nevertheless, measurements of δ15N might offer the advantage of giving insights into the N cycle without disturbing the system by adding 15N tracer. Such attempts require, however, that the complex factors affecting 15N in plants be taken into account, viz. (i) the source(s) of N (soil, precipitation, NOX, NH3, N2-fixation), (ii) the depth(s) in soil from which N is taken up, (iii) the form(s) of soil-N used (organic N, NH4+, NO3−), (iv) influences of mycorrhizal symbioses and fractionations during and after N uptake by plants, and (v) interactions between these factors and plant phenology. Because of this complexity, data on δ15N can only be used alone when certain requirements are met, e.g. when a clearly discrete N source in terms of amount and isotopic signature is studied. For example, it is recommended that N in non-N2-fixing species should differ more than 5\% from N derived by N2-fixation, and that several non-N2-fixing references are used, when data on δ15N are used to estimate Na-fixation in poorly described ecosystems. As well as giving information on N source effects, δ15N can give insights into N cycle rates. For example, high levels of N deposition onto previously N-limited systems leads to increased nitrification, which produces 15N-enriched NH4 and N-depleted NO3. As many forest plants prefer NH4−they become enriched in 15N in such circumstances. This change in plant 15N will subsequently also occur in the soil surface horizon after litter-fall, and might be a useful indicator of N saturation, especially since there is usually an increase in 15N with depth in soils of N-limited forests. Generally, interpretation of 15N measurements requires additional independent data and modelling, and benefits from a controlled experimental setting. Modelling will be greatly assisted by the development of methods to measure the 15N of small dynamic pools of N in soils. Direct comparisons with parallel low tracer level 15N studies will be necessary to further develop the interpretation of variations in 15N in soil-plant systems. Another promising approach is to study ratios of 15N: 14N together with other pairs of stable isotopes, e.g. 13C: 12C or 18O:16O, in the same ion or molecules. This approach can help to tackle the challenge of distinguishing isotopic source effects from fractionations within the system studied.},

@article{forrester_ashman_2018,
	abstract = {Invasive plants negatively impact native communities by altering ecosystem processes and reducing species diversity. Plants in the legume family are overrepresented among invasive taxa and establish in disturbed environments common in urban ecosystems. Mutualisms with rhizobia and anthropogenic activities, such as nitrogen fertilization, may be key mechanisms driving legume invasions of urban habitats. Moreover, legume species and genetic lineages within species may vary in their responses to nitrogen fertilization, making some more likely to invade than others. Despite this threat, it remains unclear whether nitrogen fertilization impacts mutualism and plant growth traits of invasive legumes in urban environments, and whether these effects depend on the genetic origin of invaders. We conducted a common garden experiment using two widespread, invasive legume species, Medicago sativa and Trifolium pratense, to test the effects of species, genetic origin of lineages within species, and nitrogen fertilization on the mutualism. Soil nitrogen was manipulated and effects on traits associated with the mutualism (nodule traits) and plant growth were quantified. Nitrogen fertilization improved nodule traits and host growth for both species, but M. sativa and certain genetic lineages of this species benefited more from fertilization than any of the tested T. pratense lineages. This work reveals how anthropogenic activities alter mutualism traits and plant growth in urban environments, potentially facilitating invasions by leguminous taxa. Because species and lineages varied in the strength of their responses to fertilization, over time some invading legumes may outcompete other plant species or lineages, leading to differential impacts on native communities in urban environments.},

@article{simonsen_et_al_2015,
	abstract = {Fertilizer application is a common anthropogenic alteration to terrestrial systems. Increased nutrient input can impact soil microbial diversity or function directly through altered soil environments, or indirectly through plant-microbe feedbacks, with potentially important effects on ecologically-important plant-associated mutualists. We investigated the impacts of plant fertilizer, containing all common macro and micronutrients on symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia), a group of bacteria that are important for plant productivity and ecosystem function. We collected rhizobia nodule isolates from natural field soil that was treated with slow-release plant fertilizer over a single growing season and compared phenotypic traits related to free-living growth and host partner quality in these isolates to those of rhizobia from unfertilized soils. Through a series of single inoculation assays in controlled glasshouse conditions, we found that isolates from fertilized field soil provided legume hosts with higher mutualistic benefits. Through growth assays on media containing variable plant fertilizer concentrations, we found that plant fertilizer was generally beneficial for rhizobia growth. Rhizobia isolated from fertilized field soil had higher growth rates in the presence of plant fertilizer compared to isolates from unfertilized field soil, indicating that plant fertilizer application favoured rhizobia isolates with higher abilities to utilize fertilizer for free-living growth. We found a positive correlation between growth responses to fertilizer and mutualism benefits among isolates from fertilized field soil, demonstrating that variable plant fertilizer induces context-dependent genetic correlations, potentially changing the evolutionary trajectory of either trait through increased trait dependencies. Our study shows that short-term application is sufficient to alter the composition of rhizobia isolates in the population or community, either directly though changes in the soil chemistry or indirectly through altered host legume feedbacks, and is potentially a strong selective agent acting on natural rhizobia populations.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic landscapes are associated with biodiversity loss and large shifts in species composition and traits. These changes predict the identities of winners and losers of future global change, and also reveal which environmental variables drive a taxon's response to land use change. We explored how the biodiversity of native bee species changes across forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes. We collected bee community data from 36 sites across a 75,000 km2 region, and analyzed bee abundance, species richness, composition, and life-history traits. Season-long bee abundance and richness were not detectably different between natural and anthropogenic landscapes, but community phenologies differed strongly, with an early spring peak followed by decline in forests, and a more extended summer season in agricultural and urban habitats. Bee community composition differed significantly between all three land use types, as did phylogenetic composition. Anthropogenic land use had negative effects on the persistence of several life-history strategies, including early spring flight season and brood parasitism, which may indicate adaptation to conditions in forest habitat. Overall, anthropogenic communities are not diminished subsets of contemporary natural communities. Rather, forest species do not persist in anthropogenic habitats, but are replaced by different native species and phylogenetic lineages preadapted to open habitats. Characterizing compositional and functional differences is crucial for understanding land use as a global change driver across large regional scales.},

@article{rocha_fellowes_2018,
	abstract = {Urbanization can alter the composition of arthropod communities. However, little is known about how urbanization affects ecological interactions. Using experimental colonies of the black bean aphid Aphis fabae Scopoli reared on Vicia faba L, we asked if patterns of predator-prey, host-parasitoid and ant-aphid mutualisms varied along an urbanization gradient across a large town in southern England. We recorded the presence of naturally occurring predators, parasitoid wasps and mutualistic ants together with aphid abundance. We examined how biotic (green areas and plant richness) and abiotic features (impervious surfaces and distance to town center) affected (1) aphid colony size, (2) the likelihood of finding predators, mutualistic ants and aphid mummies (indicating the presence of parasitoids), and (3) how the interplay among these factors affected patterns of parasitoid attack, predator abundance, mutualistic interactions and aphid abundance. Aphid abundance was best explained by the number of mutualistic ants attending the colonies. Aphid predators responded negatively to both the proportion of impervious surfaces and to the number of mutualistic ants farming the colonies, and positively to aphid population size, whereas parasitized aphids were found in colonies with higher numbers of aphids and ants. The number of mutualistic ants attending was positively associated with aphid colony size and negatively with the number of aphid predators. Our findings suggest that for insect-natural enemy interactions, urbanization may affect some groups, while not influencing others, and that local effects (mutualists, host plant presence) will also be key determinants of how urban ecological communities are formed.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is quickly changing natural and agricultural landscapes, with consequences for the herbivorous arthropods dwelling in or near cities. Here, we review the evidence for the effects of urbanization on the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions. We first summarize how abiotic factors associated with urbanization affect the ecology and evolution of herbivorous arthropods. Next, we explore how urbanization affects plant-herbivore interactions, by considering how urban environments may disrupt top-down and bottom-up ecological processes that affect herbivory. Abiotic changes in the urban environment, such as the urban heat island effect, have caused shifts in phenology for some herbivorous arthropods. Other abiotic changes in urban areas, including water availability, pollution, and habitat fragmentation, have resulted in changes to physiology, behavior, and population abundance. Native species richness tends to decline in urban areas; however, changes in abundance appear to be species specific. These shifts in ecology suggest that urbanization could affect both adaptive and non-adaptive evolution of herbivorous arthropods and their host plants in urban environments. However, plant-herbivore interactions may be dramatically altered if either arthropods or plants are unable to tolerate urban environments. Thus, while some species can physiologically acclimate or genetically adapt to the abiotic urban environment, many species are expected to decline in abundance. We conclude with suggestions for future research to advance our understanding of how urbanization alters the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions.},

@article{rivkin_et_al_2020,
	abstract = {Urbanization alters the landscape, degrades and fragments habitats, and can have a profound effect on species interactions. Plant--pollinator networks may be particularly sensitive to urbanization, because plants and their insect pollinators have been shown to respond to urbanization both positively and negatively. To better understand the relationship between urbanization, pollinator behavior, and season on pollinator-mediated plant reproduction, we created 30 experimental plant populations along an urbanization gradient in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. To test how urbanization affects plant reproduction and between-patch pollen dispersal, we created a standard hermaphroditic plant patch at each site, and a male-sterile plant patch at a subset of sites. We measured plant reproduction in the early and late summer in each of 2 years. Plants in urban sites produced significantly fewer flowers than plants in the nonurban sites, whereas seed number per plant either increased or decreased with urbanization, depending on the season. Experimental populations in urban sites also exhibited reduced pollen dispersal between patches. Pollen dispersal between patches was greatest early in the summer and declined with increased impervious surface and proximity to the city. Together, our results are likely caused by variation in environmental conditions and pollinator services across the urban gradient, resulting in pollen limitation and pollen dispersal differences among sites. Our work adds to the small but growing body of literature on urban plant-pollinator interactions and suggests that responses to urbanization are context-dependent.},

	abstract = {We simulate nitrogen deposition over the US in 2006--2008 by using the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model at 1/2◦×2/3◦ horizontal resolution over North America and adjacent oceans. US emissions of NOx and NH3 in the model are 6.7 and 2.9 Tg N a−1 respectively, including a 20 \% natural contribution for each. Ammonia emissions are a factor of 3 lower in winter than summer, providing a good match to US network observations of NHx (≡NH3 gas + ammonium aerosol) and ammonium wet deposition fluxes. Model comparisons to observed deposition fluxes and surface air concentrations of oxidized nitrogen species (NOy) show overall good agreement but excessive wintertime HNO3 production over the US Midwest and Northeast. This suggests a model overestimate N2O5 hydrolysis in aerosols, and a possible factor is inhibition by aerosol nitrate. Model results indicate a total nitrogen deposition flux of 6.5 Tg N a−1 over the contiguous US, including 4.2 as NOy and 2.3 as NHx. Domestic anthropogenic, foreign anthropogenic, and natural sources contribute respectively 78 \%, 6 \%, and 16 \% of total nitrogen deposition over the contiguous US in the model. The domestic anthropogenic contribution generally exceeds 70 \% in the east and in populated areas of the west, and is typically 50--70 \% in remote areas of the west. Total nitrogen deposition in the model exceeds 10 kg N ha−1 a−1 over 35 \% of the contiguous US.},

@article{zheng_et_al_2019,
	abstract = {Biological nitrogen (N) fixation (BNF), an important source of N in terrestrial ecosystems, plays a critical role in terrestrial nutrient cycling and net primary productivity. Currently, large uncertainty exists regarding how nutrient availability regulates terrestrial BNF and the drivers responsible for this process. We conducted a global meta‐analysis of terrestrial BNF in response to N, phosphorus (P), and micronutrient (Micro) addition across different biomes (i.e, tropical/subtropical forest, savanna, temperate forest, grassland, boreal forest, and tundra) and explored whether the BNF responses were affected by fertilization regimes (nutrient‐addition rates, duration, and total load) and environmental factors (mean annual temperature [MAT], mean annual precipitation [MAP], and N deposition). The results showed that N addition inhibited terrestrial BNF (by 19.0\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 17.7\%‒20.3\%); hereafter), Micro addition stimulated terrestrial BNF (30.4\% [25.7\%‒35.3\%]), and P addition had an inconsistent effect on terrestrial BNF, i.e., inhibiting free‐living N fixation (7.5\% [4.4\%‒10.6\%]) and stimulating symbiotic N fixation (85.5\% [25.8\%‒158.7\%]). Furthermore, the response ratios (i.e., effect sizes) of BNF to nutrient addition were smaller in low‐latitude ({\textless}30$\,^{\circ}$) biomes (8.5\%‒36.9\%) than in mid‐/high‐latitude (≥30$\,^{\circ}$) biomes (32.9\%‒61.3\%), and the sensitivity (defined as the absolute value of response ratios) of BNF to nutrients in mid‐/high‐latitude biomes decreased with decreasing latitude (p ≤ 0.009; linear/logarithmic regression models). Fertilization regimes did not affect this phenomenon (p {\textgreater} 0.05), but environmental factors did affect it (p {\textless} 0.001) because MAT, MAP, and N deposition accounted for 5\%‒14\%, 10\%‒32\%, and 7\%‒18\% of the variance in the BNF response ratios in cold (MAT {\textless} 15$\,^{\circ}$C), lowrainfall (MAP {\textless} 2,500 mm), and low‐N‐deposition ({\textless}7 kg ha−1 year−1) biomes, respectively. Overall, our meta‐analysis depicts a global pattern of nutrient impacts on terrestrial BNF and indicates that certain types of global change (i.e., warming, elevated precipitation and N deposition) may reduce the sensitivity of BNF in response to nutrient enrichment in mid‐/high‐latitude biomes.},

	abstract = {The majority of humanity now lives in cities or towns, with this proportion -expected to continue increasing for the foreseeable future. As novel ecosystems, urban areas offer an ideal opportunity to examine multi-s- calar processes involved in community assembly as well as the role of human activities in modulating environmental drivers of biodiversity. Although ecologists have made great strides in recent decades at documenting ecological relationships in urban areas, much remains unknown, and we still need to identify the major -ecological factors, aside from habitat loss, behind the persistence or extinction of species and guilds of species in cities. Given this paucity of knowledge, there is an immediate need to facilitate collaborative, interdisciplinary research on the patterns and drivers of biodiversity in c- ities at multiple spatial scales. In this review, we introduce a new conceptual framework for understanding the filtering processes that mold diversity of urban floras and faunas. We h- ypothesize that the following hierarchical series of filters influence species distributions in cities: (1) regional climatic and biogeographical factors; (2) human facilitation; (3) urban form and development history; (4) socioeconomic and cultural factors; and (5) species interactions. In addition to these filters, life history and functional traits of species are important in determining community assembly and act at multiple spatial scales. Using these filters as a conceptual framework can help frame future research needed to elucidate processes of community assembly in urban a- reas. Understanding how humans influence community structure and processes will aid in the management, design, and planning of our cities to best support biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Human production of food and energy is the dominant continental process that breaks the triple bond in molecular nitrogen (N2) and creates reactive nitrogen (Nr) species. Circulation of anthropogenic Nr in Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere has a wide variety of consequences, which are magnified with time as Nr moves along its biogeochemical pathway. The same atom of Nr can cause multiple effects in the atmosphere, in terrestrial ecosystems, in freshwater and marine systems, and on human health. We call this sequence of effects the nitrogen cascade. As the cascade progresses, the origin of Nr becomes unimportant. Reactive nitrogen does not cascade at the same rate through all environmental systems; some systems have the ability to accumulate Nr, which leads to lag times in the continuation of the cascade. These lags slow the cascade and result in Nr accumulation in certain reservoirs, which in turn can enhance the effects of Nr on that environment. The only way to eliminate Nr accumulation and stop the cascade is to convert Nr back to nonreactive N2.},

	abstract = {Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of life{\~O}s genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogenfixing bacteria are responsible for c. 5--20\% (grassland and savannah) to 80\% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75\% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that c. 20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth. Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.},

@article{hirsch_1992,
	abstract = {SUMMARY Many legumes respond to Rhizobium inoculation by developing unique structures known as nodules on their roots. The development of a legume nodule in which rhizobia convert atmospheric N.j into ammonia is a finely tuned process. Gene expression from both partners of the symbiosis must be temporally and spatially coordinated. Exactly how this coordination takes place is an area of intense study. Nodule morphogenesis appears to be elicited by at least two distinct signals: one from Rhizobium, a product of the nod genes (Nod factor), and a second signal, which is generated within plant tissues after treatment with Nod factor. The identity of the second signal is unknown but changes in the balance of endogenous plant hormones or the sensitivity of plant tissues to these hormones are likely to be involved. These hormonal changes may be triggered by endogenous flavonoids produced by the root in response to inoculation with Rhizobium. There is some controversy as to whether the legume nodule is an organ sui generis or a highly derived lateral root. A resolution of this question may become more critical as attempts to induce nodules on non-legume hosts, such as rice or maize, increase in number and scope.},

Rhizobia must exist in soil and compete with other members of the microbiota before infecting legumes and forming N2-fixing bacteroids. These dramatic lifestyle and developmental changes are underpinned by large genomes and even more complex pan-genomes, which encompass the whole population and are subject to rapid genetic exchange. The ability to respond to plant signals and chemoattractants and to colonize nutrient-rich roots are crucial for the competitive success of these bacteria. The availability of a large body of genomic, physiological, biochemical and ecological studies makes rhizobia unique models for investigating community interactions and plant colonization.},

The rapid effects of N supply on nodule initiation have been mainly described when N sources are present at the moment of Rhizobium inoculation or purified Nod Factors addition. We recently reported that high ammonium nitrate growth conditions might also strongly affect the nodulation competence of Lotus japonicus plants, prior to the Rhizobium inoculation. This is a long-term effect, which suggests a change of the general nutritional status as the signal controlling the reduced nodulation capacities. The mechanisms underlying these inhibitory pathways are apparently different and the identification of the molecular actors involved may provide new insights into the linkage between N environmental changes and root organogenesis programs.},

	abstract = {Evidence suggests that natural populations can evolve to better tolerate the novel environmental conditions associated with urban areas. Studies of adaptive divergence in urban areas often examine one or a few traits at a time from populations residing only at the most extreme urban and nonurban habitats. Thus, whether urbanization drives divergence in many traits simultaneously in a manner that varies with the degree of urbanization remains unclear. To address this gap, we generated seed families of white clover (Trifolium repens) collected from 27 populations along an urbanization gradient in Toronto, Canada, grew them in a common garden, and measured 14 phenotypic traits. Families from urban sites had evolved later phenology and germination, larger flowers, thinner stolons, reduced cyanogenesis, greater biomass and greater seed set. Pollinator observations revealed near-complete turnover of pollinator morphological groups along the urbanization gradient, which may explain some of the observed divergences in floral traits and phenology. Our results suggest that adaptation to urban environments involves multiple traits.},

	abstract = {Cities experience elevated temperature, CO2, and nitrogen deposition decades ahead of the global average, such that biological response to urbanization may predict response to future climate change. This hypothesis remains untested due to a lack of complementary urban and long-term observations. Here, we examine the response of an herbivore, the scale insect Melanaspis tenebricosa, to temperature in the context of an urban heat island, a series of historical temperature fluctuations, and recent climate warming. We survey M. tenebricosa on 55 urban street trees in Raleigh, NC, 342 herbarium specimens collected in the rural southeastern United States from 1895 to 2011, and at 20 rural forest sites represented by both modern (2013) and historical samples. We relate scale insect abundance to August temperatures and find that M. tenebricosa is most common in the hottest parts of the city, on historical specimens collected during warm time periods, and in present-day rural forests compared to the same sites when they were cooler. Scale insects reached their highest densities in the city, but abundance peaked at similar temperatures in urban and historical datasets and tracked temperature on a decadal scale. Although urban habitats are highly modified, species response to a key abiotic factor, temperature, was consistent across urban and rural-forest ecosystems. Cities may be an appropriate but underused system for developing and testing hypotheses about biological effects of climate change. Future work should test the applicability of this model to other groups of organisms.},

Past research supports that competition for floral resources affects bee foragers, but mostly with observational evidence and rarely linking foraging with population change. An increasing number of studies ask whether resources limit pollinator populations, using field measurements of reproductive success, time series and models. Findings generally support positive effects of floral resources, but also highlight the potential importance of nest site availability and parasitism. In parallel, recent experiments strengthen evidence that competition reduces access to floral resources. Developing common currencies for quantifying floral resources and integrating analyses of multiple limiting factors will further strengthen our understanding of competitive interactions and their effects in the Anthropocene.},
